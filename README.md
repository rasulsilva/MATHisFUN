# MATHisFUN
validate, visualize and explore mathematical concepts, proofs, and conjectures!

Here is a list of the projects contained in this repository with brief descriptions:

1. collatz.py - this is a visualization of the Collatz conjecture (google it!). The plot displays the starting value on the x axis
and the sequence length(the number of calculations required to get to 1) on the y axis.

2.twinprimes.py - Here, we visualize the seemingly unpredictable nature of the twin prime distribution. For any given range (0 to rangetop),
we calculate all of the twin prime pairs and show them on a plot as follows:
               
                   1 if twin prime
          F(x) =                          where x = the number in question
                   0 if not twin prime
