validate, visualize and explore mathematical concepts, proofs, and conjectures!

Here is a list of the projects contained in this repository with brief descriptions:

1. collatz.py - this is a visualization of the Collatz conjecture which is a repeated application of conditional calcultions to a starting value defined as shown below. The conjecture states that the sequence will reach 0 for any number. The plot displays the starting value on the x axis and the sequence length(the number of calculations required to get to 1) on the y axis.
               
               N/2        if N is even       
         N =                                   repeated application of these conditions to any number 
               3*N + 1    if N is odd          will produce 1 eventually (or so the conjecture states)                                                  
               
2.twinprimes.py - Here, we visualize the seemingly unpredictable nature of the twin prime distribution. For any given range (0 to rangetop), we calculate all of the twin prime pairs and show them on a plot as follows:
               
                   1 if twin prime
          F(x) =                          where x = the number in question
                   0 if not twin prime
